Riding a bus back home;
Green fields, grey skies, and a blank slate.
<!--more-->

Life whizzes past, human, animal and mechanical;
Yet do we have time to stop and stare?

Provoked drivers, carefree farmers;
Blissful men serving water in the sun with no care.

Pretty girls, laughing kids playing in the fields;
Toll booth people asking for the fare.

Oh is this just a cacophony I see while moving;
Or did I just stop and stare?
