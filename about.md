I'm Saksham Sharma as is obvious. A pre-final year undergrad armed with a Laptop; Tall, Lanky and over-energetic punjabi guy, that's me.

I used to be a super studious guy till class 12, and cleared my JEE (yes, THE exam in India), with national ranks of 10 and 138 in Mains and Advanced respectively, though I would've loved the opposite pair. Anyhow, that landed me at IIT Kanpur, a decision I'll never regret.

Now there's much more to me rather than just studying, I love to code, play badminton, a little gaming on the side, some writing to vent my thoughts, and of course hanging out with my friends. Oh, I also love music, classic rock, prog rock, alternative, and to lesser extents pretty much every genre out there. I can listen to Porcupine Tree, Pink Floyd and the likes all day long. Okay, not a lot, but enough for me.

I love coding in any form, and Linux, anything about it. You *should* look at [my Github account](https://github.com/sakshamsharma). Also, I'll mention, the same way I've mentioned in my old blogs, that I started actual coding on coming to college, just about an year and a half back. (Well if you consider coding as writing loops and not knowing about arrays, then I'm afraid my claim is wrong). I did have to spend a huge, *huge* lot of time programming to get to this level. [My journey](https://www.acehack.org/posts/2015-07-01-voyage.html) has been a fine one.

As for writing, I used to love reading literature when I was a kid. Writing took a back seat after a stage, but doesn't mean I don't love to scribble.

Go ahead and give some stuff here a read. Come back for more :)
